            <span style="color: rgb(25, 100, 201);font-weight: bold">Motivation:</span>
            Recent advancements in video generation allow models to create high-quality videos, 
            but fixed sequence lengths limit their ability to extend content.
             In this paper, we explore length extrapolation techniques that <span style="font-weight: bold">generate new and temporally coherent content 
             without longer training videos</span>. Current extrapolation strategies lead to <span style="font-weight: bold">temporal repetition</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">slow motion</span>,
              indicating a gap in understanding how positional encodings affect video extrapolation.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color: rgb(25, 100, 201);font-weight: bold">Analysis:</span>
            We systematically analyze the role of individual frequency components in positional, 
            discovering that high frequencies capture rapid movements and short-term dependencies,
             inducing temporal repetition, while low frequencies encode long-term dependencies with slow motion. 
             Furthermore, we surprisingly identify an <span style="font-weight: bold">intrinsic frequency</span> that primarily dictates repetition 
             patterns among all components during extrapolation.
             <br>
             <br>
             <span style="color: rgb(25, 100, 201);font-weight: bold">Method:</span>
             Building on these insights, we propose Reducing Intrinsic Frequency for Length Extrapolation (RIFLEx),
             <span style="font-weight: bold">a minimal yet effective</span> solution that lowers the intrinsic frequency to ensure it remains within a single 
              cycle after extrapolation, without requiring additional modifications.

The room is filled with wooden furniture and colorful wall decorations, suggesting a cheerful and domestic atmosphere. The porcupine's large eyes and expressive face convey a sense of lightheartedness and curiosity. The camera maintains a low angle, close to the ground, providing an intimate view of the character's actions without any movement, focusing on the playful and curious mood of the scene. The visual style is characteristic of contemporary 3D animation, with vibrant colors and smooth textures that create a polished and engaging look. The scene transitions to an outdoor environment, showcasing a sunny, verdant landscape with rocks, trees, and grass, indicating a natural, possibly forest-like setting. The presence of a small character in the final frame suggests the continuation of a narrative or the introduction of new characters.</p>

Its eyes are wide and happy as it jogs forward, scanning the branches, flowers, and leaves as it walks. The path is narrow as it makes its way between all the plants. the scene is captured from a ground-level angle, following the cat closely, giving a low and intimate perspective. The image is cinematic with warm tones and a grainy texture. The scattered daylight between the leaves and plants above creates a warm contrast, accentuating the cat’s orange fur. The shot is clear and sharp, with a shallow depth of field.

             While the NTK in HunyuanVideo coincidentally avoids repetition at 2× extrapolation, this stems from an unintended effect that happens to satisfy the non-repetition condition rather than its intended mechanism. At longer extrapolations (e.g., 2.3×), significant repetition still occurs.
